# Evidential version of PhysNet
Based on the Pytorch version of PhysNet, an evidential layer is implemented. 

### Setting up the environment

We recommend to use [ Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html) for the creation of a virtual environment. 

Once in miniconda, you can create a virtual enviroment called *physnet_torch* from the `.yml` file with the following command

``` 
conda env create --file enviroment.yml
```
 
To activate the virtual environment use the command:

```
conda activate physnet_torch
